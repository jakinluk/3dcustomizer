Take a look at the KitBuilder technology research in the docs/competitors folder. 
Now I want to build a proof of concept application that mimics the product from KitBuilder. I just need the component that is responsible for 3D rendering And customization. Thermoactive shirt can be an example product I want for demo. 
Use Three.js for the rendering. 
The goal is I can see how the Twitter product looks for different sites. I want to have a few options of the customization like: dodawanie napisów, zmienianie kolorów rękawów, zmienianie koloru materiału na brzuchu, na plecach. 
Contra as well to be able to zoom in/out.
